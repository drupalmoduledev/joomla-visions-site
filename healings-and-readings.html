    <p class="style37"><span class="style9">Ryan Long presents Our Natural Companions</span></p>
    <p class="style38">Have you ever experienced an unidentifiable connection with an animal either for a brief moment or an entire lifetime? We are of nature at our source. Unfortunately, we have been domesticated, to a degree, removed from our deep connection and understanding of the natural world. However, the natural world has not given up on us. We are constantly sent messages, guidance and offerings of companionship by birds, trees, four legged animals, and insects that live just outside the âsafetyâ of our front door. </p>
    <p class="style38">Have you been visited by an animal, be it four legged or winged, where there was a feeling of âout of the ordinaryâ or even âstrangely familiarâ? Possibly, noticing an animal multiple times in a day or have you been stopped dead in your tracks driving down the road? If thatâs not an attempt of trying to get your attention then what is? </p>
    <p class="style38">This is no accident, coincidence or chance encounter. There is important information regarding your life right here in this moment just waiting to be acknowledged.</p>
    <p class="style38">Through expanding your awareness, slowing down, opening your heart and tapping into that seat of primal connection that flows in all of us you have the ability to gain greater clarity, confidence, trust, compassion and power in your own path and the direction you choose. This is available for people of all levels of involvement in a deeper connection with their true selves. </p>
    <p class="style38">Benefit from greater levels ofâ¦ <br />
      * Clarity <br />
      * Trust <br />
      * Confidence <br />
      * Inner strength <br />
      * Joy <br />
      * Closure <br />
      * Incite <br />
      * Companionship <br />
      * Motivation <br />
      * Peace </p>
    <p class="style38">Ryan is a lifelong resident of the area and spends a great deal of his time along the various landscapes this beautiful nook has to offer. Ryan is trained in Polarity Therapy at an RPP level and also is a certified personal trainer. His deepened connection with spirit and the universe began in his early twenties through the exact avenue he offers to share with you. </p>
    <p class="style38">âThe world I lived in simply didnât work anymore, if it ever did. I felt upside down, helpless and unmotivated. At almost that exact time a new door opened for me and I began feeling an overwhelming connection and attraction to nature. As if there was an entirely different force or depth to it. Life began to glow and this was perpetuated by my numerous encounters with Red Tailed Hawk. I began researching and asking questions and before I knew it I gained a new form of communication and insight into my life. I no longer felt like a one man show, I was part of a team or tribe. My life began to make sense, I had direction, and confidence in my action.â </p>

Intuition is not a realm reserved for just a special few.Â As sentient beings we all have innate intuitive abilities.Â However our willingness to look at our ideas about our reality have everything to do with whether or not we are willing to step up and energize not just our intuition, but all our innate abilities.
