In this class Peg will  introduce a new angel to you each week. We will discuss the angel, how it can  guide us, the intention in working with the specific angel, the chakra  connected with the angel or the color ray, and a few other facts. There is a  worksheet that will be available to write this information down or you can keep  a journal too. We will talk of the clairs to help with understanding the  connection to each angel, and how we are all have different strengths using our  senses. There will be discussion each week of the previous week&rsquo;s angels and  then discussion of the next week&rsquo;s angel. We may have a short meditation for  the next week&rsquo;s angel. </p>
    <p>This series of  classes is an inner journey to get to know our archangels and how they can help  us. We, in turn, can share with others our understanding of how the angels  guide us each day. There will be daily journaling of experiences and also journaling  with my book, Living in The Heart Place with Your Angels: Daily Angelical  Whispers throughout The Year.  The book  will be included in the cost of the 10-week class. </p>

    <p class="style38">Have you ever experienced an unidentifiable connection with an animal either for a brief moment or an entire lifetime? We are of nature at our source. Unfortunately, we have been domesticated, to a degree, removed from our deep connection and understanding of the natural world. However, the natural world has not given up on us. We are constantly sent messages, guidance and offerings of companionship by birds, trees, four legged animals, and insects that live just outside the “safety” of our front door. </p>
    <p class="style38">Have you been visited by an animal, be it four legged or winged, where there was a feeling of “out of the ordinary” or even “strangely familiar”? Possibly, noticing an animal multiple times in a day or have you been stopped dead in your tracks driving down the road? If that’s not an attempt of trying to get your attention then what is? </p>
    <p class="style38">This is no accident, coincidence or chance encounter. There is important information regarding your life right here in this moment just waiting to be acknowledged.</p>

    <p class="style38">Ryan is a lifelong resident of the area and spends a great deal of his time along the various landscapes this beautiful nook has to offer. Ryan is trained in Polarity Therapy at an RPP level and also is a certified personal trainer. His deepened connection with spirit and the universe began in his early twenties through the exact avenue he offers to share with you. </p>
    <p class="style38">“The world I lived in simply didn’t work anymore, if it ever did. I felt upside down, helpless and unmotivated. At almost that exact time a new door opened for me and I began feeling an overwhelming connection and attraction to nature. As if there was an entirely different force or depth to it. Life began to glow and this was perpetuated by my numerous encounters with Red Tailed Hawk. I began researching and asking questions and before I knew it I gained a new form of communication and insight into my life. I no longer felt like a one man show, I was part of a team or tribe. My life began to make sense, I had direction, and confidence in my action.” </p>

      · The first 5 people to register receive a free gift! <br />
      · Sign up at Universal Visions or call 978-462-4649 </p>
    <p class="style26">Ever think you have intuitive abilities and then think “No, not me, it’s all just a coincidence”? Intuition is not a realm reserved for just a special few. As sentient beings we all have innate intuitive abilities. However our willingness to look at our ideas about our reality have everything to do with whether or not we are willing to step up and energize not just our intuition, but all our innate abilities. In this workshop we will explore how your picture of reality affects what your intuition feels like, looks like, sounds like and how you can tune into it with more frequency and ease. </p>
